# DBMS Project Kiran's Gym

Being fit and healthy is very important. To emphasise the importance of healthcare and fitness, we have built this example of a real-life gym. Our website allows people to sign up and choose their subscription packs or log in and check their schedules. This is done with the help of the vast database that we have developed and some back-end linking of the website to the database. The database contains all relevant information about the members, trainers, exercises, equipment, subscription packs and merchandise. The website also gives information about the gym as well as displays the merchandise available for purchase there. Effectively, we are using this website as a means to motivate people to care more for their body and stay stronger for longer.
